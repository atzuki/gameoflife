# gameoflife
Welcome to the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) adaptation of the Game of Life (or simply Life), developed by John Horton Conway. Newcomers have a chance to learn about the principles of Life by executing or modifying the code.

Before explaining how to use the code, it is important to cover the principles of Life as follows: 

1) If a cell is in state 1 at time t and has exactly two (no more, n less) of its neighbors also in state 1 at time t, then at time t+1 it    will remain in state 1.

2) Whatever the state of a cell at time t, if exactly three (no more, no less) of its eight neighbors are in state 1 at time t, then at    
   time t+1 it will be in state 1.

3) For any other situation at time t, then at time t+1 the cell will be in state 0.
